# React_ToDoList_Practice
Created with CodeSandbox

Mark Vadasz

I started this project from scratch to reinforce React concepts learned about in tutorials. My aim is to create a To Do List or Task Manager. The app will take input in the form of text from the user, the add button will add the text to a new div, and append it to the list. The remove task button will remove the desired task.
